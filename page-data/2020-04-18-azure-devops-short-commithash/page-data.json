Helpful tracers I’m using are branch name, commithash and the build number. In my current project I’m using Azure DevOps Pipelines for building and they provide a lot of helpful predefined variables (find a full list <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&#x26;tabs=yaml\">here</a>). Anyway there is one variable I’m missing: short commit hash.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course Microsoft could provide this variable out of the box but I also get the point that requirements are highly different. While I prefer the 8-char long hash other might be happy with seven or ten characters. I will show you that it’s not that complicated to trim your own commit hash and share the snippet I’m using for almost every pipeline:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- powershell: |\n    $shortHash = $env:BUILD_SOURCEVERSION.subString(0, 7)\n    Write-Host &quot;##vso[task.setvariable variable=shortHash]$shortHash&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>In bash it’s even easier:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- powershell: |\n    echo &quot;##vso[task.setvariable variable=shortHash]${BUILD_SOURCEVERSION:0:7}&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>And this is how you can use it in you pipeline later (remember that the template experession syntax ${{shortHash}} won’t work as the variable needs to be evaluated at runtime)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2\n    displayName: Publish .NET Application\n    inputs:\n    command: &#39;publish&#39;\n    arguments: &#39;--configuration &#39;Release&#39; --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) --version-suffix $(shortHash)-$(Build.BuildNumber)&#39;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Azure DevOps: Get short commit hash in build pipeline","date":"July 27, 2020","description":"Retreiving the short commit hash for the current build"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-04-18-azure-devops-short-commithash/","previous":null,"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
